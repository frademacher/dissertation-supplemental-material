## Complete Model Code of Concrete Syntax Running Example
This part of the dissertation's supplemental material comprises the complete model code of the [food ordering case study microservice architecture](https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application) as included in the dissertation.

Furthermore, we provide the complete code of the derived intermediate models:
- The `intermediate` folder comprises the intermediate models for the modeling approach that integrates technology information directly into service models.
- The `intermediate-alternative` folder comprises the intermediate models for the technology mapping approach that keeps technology information in mapping instead of service models.
- The complete intermediate models for the example intermediate models in the dissertation can be found in the following files:
  - Example intermediate domain model: `/intermediate-alternative/mapping models/Order/OrderDomain_Order.xmi`
  - Example intermediate service model: `/intermediate/service models/Order.xmi`
  - Example intermediate operation model: `/intermediate/operation models/Order.xmi`
